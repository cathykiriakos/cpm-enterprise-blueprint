## Part 1: Understanding What CPM Needs (Problem-Solution Mapping)

### The Problems (From Job Description)

| JD Language | Underlying Problem | Your Solution Component |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| "Modernize and unify all CRMs, donor, subscription, and audience platforms" | Fragmented data across WBEZ and Sun-Times post-merger | **Identity Resolution Engine** - Two-phase matching algorithm |
| "Reduce silos and enable personalization" | Departments can't see unified constituent view | **Golden Record Schema** - Single source of truth |
| "Develop a cohesive systems roadmap" | No architectural vision | **Architecture Documentation** - Phased implementation plan |
| "Data governance practices" | Inconsistent metrics, no ownership | **Metrics Framework** - YAML-driven definitions with owners |
| "Hands-on...scoping, troubleshooting, integrations" | Need technical leader, not just manager | **Working Code** - Runnable ML models, connectors |
| "Build data foundations for lifecycle marketing" | Can't do predictive outreach | **ML Models** - Churn prediction, upgrade propensity |
| "Translate strategic goals to technical requirements" | Gap between business and engineering | **Documentation style** - Business context in all code |
